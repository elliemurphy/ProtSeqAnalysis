# ProtSeqAnalysis
Data Science and Machine Learning Coursework.

**A piece of software that explores protein sequences from land plant gene families. There are three sections to the software:**
1. A simple error checking function that identifies if there are any characters in sequences that do not represent an amino acid
2. A function to calculate amino acid composition of a protein sequence and plot the results
3. A final function allowing the identification of conserved motifs in protein sequences

To run:
1. Any protein sequence may be run through the error checking and amino acid composition functions. An example protein sequence derived from *Arabidopsis thaliana* encoding SLAH1, a protein bearing similarity to the well-known SLAC1 protein, has been included in the Markdown for use
2. A number of .bgme files have also been uploaded as sample data for the conserved motif search function. Save these files to the working directory
3.
